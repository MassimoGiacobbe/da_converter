# FPGA Implementation of DACs on DESOC1 Board

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of two different Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) on the DESOC1 FPGA board. Alongside the hardware design, C code is provided to control the DACs using the onboard processor.

## Features
- **Two DAC Implementations:** Two distinct DAC architectures implemented in VHDL for the DESOC1 board.
- **Processor Control:** C code for the processor to interact with and control the DACs.
- **FPGA Design Flow:** The project includes synthesis, simulation, and hardware testing steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- DESOC1 FPGA board
- Basic knowledge of VHDL and C programming
- Vivado (or another FPGA synthesis tool)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MassimoGiacobbe/da_converter.git
